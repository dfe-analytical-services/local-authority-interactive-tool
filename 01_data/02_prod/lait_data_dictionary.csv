Inclusion of these indicators will encourage the continued prioritisation of breastfeeding support locally. Increases in breastfeeding are expected to reduce illness in young children, have health benefits for the infant and the mother and result in cost savings to the NHS through reduced hospital admission for the treatment of infection in infants (Quigley et al 2007.) Breast milk provides the ideal nutrition for infants in the first stages of life. There is evidence that babies who are breast fed experience lower levels of gastro-intestinal and respiratory infection. Observational studies have shown that breastfeeding is associated with lower levels of child obesity. Mothers who do not breastfeed have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers and may find it more difficult to return to their pre-pregnancy weight (World Cancer Research Fund; DH, cited in NICE Public health guidance PH11 https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph11/chapter/2-public-health-need-and-practice). Current national and international guidance recommends exclusive breastfeeding for newborns and for the first six months of infancy. http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/infantfeeding_recommendation/en/index.html  http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11943/40097/40097.pdf Increasing rates of breastfeeding initiation and continuation is also recommended within the DH Healthy Child Programme Breastfeeding initiation and uptake at 6-8 weeks are included in the NICE proposals for the Commissioning Outcomes Framework The longer-term strategic solution for data collection and reporting for this indicator is NHS England's Community Services Dataset (formerly the Children and Young Peoples (CYPHS) data set). It is mandatory for the providers of public funded services to submit the dataset to NHS England. Whilst the data set is operational and reporting has begun, providers are at different stages of maturity with their submissions or readiness to flow the data therefore it is expected to take some additional time for this data set to reach sufficient coverage for reporting purposes.

Definition : Children and family social workers are social workers registered with Social Work England (SWE) working in a local authority in a children’s services department or, if working in an authority where the services are joined up, a social worker that works primarily on children and families work. Children and family social workers are employed and paid directly by the local authority.

NOTE: Kingston upon Thames and Richmond upon Thames submit a joint census return each year through Achieving for Children, a social enterprise company created by the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames to provide their children’s services.

It requires that children be assessed against the EYFS Profile in the summer term of the academic year in which they turn 5.

The EYFS Profile is intended to provide an accurate representation of each child’s development at the end of the EYFS to support their transition into year 1. It is made up of an assessment of the child’s outcomes in relation to 17 early learning goals (ELGs) across 7 areas of learning.

The 3 prime areas of learning are: communication and language; personal, social and emotional development; and physical development. These prime areas are particularly important for children’s healthy development and are the basis for successful learning in the other 4 specific areas of learning: literacy; mathematics; understanding the world; and expressive arts and design.

The EYFS reforms were introduced in September 2021. As part of those reforms, the EYFS Profile was significantly revised. It is therefore not possible to directly compare assessment outcomes since 2021/22 with earlier years.",2023-11-01,"45597","DfE","Number and percentage of children having a good level of development:  This is a count and percentage of children who were at the expected level for all 12 ELGs within the 5 areas of learning relating to: communication and language; personal, social and emotional development; physical development; literacy; and mathematics.

For example, say a learner gains an AS level (25% L3) in 2009 and then an A level (50% L3) in the same subject in 2010, then discounting means the person has 25% of a full Level 3 in 2009 and then 50% in 2010 as the AS level is replaced by the full A level.",2024-04-01,"45748","DfE","Several data sources are matched together at an individual level, using personal identifiers.

Progress 8 - Progress 8 aims to capture the progress a pupil makes from the end of Key Stage 2 to the end of Key Stage 4. It compares pupils' achievement - their Attainment 8 score - with the national average Attainment 8 score of all pupils who had a similar starting point (or ‘prior attainment’), calculated using assessment results from the end of primary school. Progress 8 is a relative measure, therefore the national average Progress 8 score for all pupils is very close to zero. It can be used to compare the progress of different pupil characteristics.  A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils in the group make on average approximately a grade more progress than the national average; a score of -0.5 means they make on average approximately half a grade less progress than average.

Allocated on first entry to a school, the UPN is generated using a nationally specified formula and is expected to remain with a pupil throughout their school career regardless of any change in school or local authority. Local authorities are required to return UPNs as part of the SSDA903 return. For more information on matching using UPN, see Outcomes for children in need, including children looked after by local authorities in England, Methodology – Explore education statistics – GOV.UK (explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk) Once matched, children whose date of birth differed between the SSDA903 collection and the school census were removed.","https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/children-looked-after-in-england-including-adoptions",NA,"Financial Year",NA

Progress 8 is a relative measure, therefore the national average Progress 8 score for all pupils is very close to zero. It can be used to compare the progress of different pupil characteristics.  A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils in the group make on average approximately a grade more progress than the national average; a score of -0.5 means they make on average approximately half a grade less progress than average.

Appeals to the Tribunal can be made in relation to a number of different decisions a Local Authority would make relating to that system which included the refusal to assess a child with special educational needs, the refusal to issue a statement of SEN following that assessment or the contents of the statement once it has been finalised.",2024-06-01,"45809","DfE","The Children and Families Act 2014 reformed the system of support across education, health and social care to ensure that each of the services were organised with the needs and preferences of the child and their family firmly at the centre, from birth up to the age of 25.  As a result of the SEND reforms, the MoJ and the Department for Education (DfE) publicly consulted on the future of the SEND Tribunal appeal rate between December 2017 and February 2018. The appeal rate to the SEND Tribunal is now published as a percentage of all ‘appealable decisions’ on a calendar year basis.

Total Appealable Decisions is calculated from data collected by the DfE from the annual SEN2 data return, which is mandatory for local authorities to complete. The Total Appealable Decisions figure is calculated as the sum total of the following:
- Number of initial requests for Education, Health and Care (EHC) assessments refused
- Number of assessments completed and a decision made not to issue an EHC plan
- Number with an EHC plan as at January each year
- Number of EHC plans ceased because the special educational needs of the child or young person are being met without an EHC plan","https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tribunals-statistics",2,"Calendar Year",NA

The proportion of pupils eligible for (and claiming) Free School Meals (FSM) can change over time depending on economic factors affecting employment and earnings and any changes to eligibility criteria. This means that in some years, when the proportion of pupils eligible for FSM is lower, the cohort eligible for FSM can be relatively more disadvantaged compared to All Other Pupils than in other years.

Caveats

1) There may be pupils who are eligible for FSM but do not claim for a number of reasons. Such pupils will not be classified as eligible for FSM for the purposes of this measure.
2) Pupils may have been eligible for FSM in earlier school years, but not when aged 15. Such pupils will not be recorded as eligible for FSM in this measure.","https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/widening-participation-in-higher-education",NA,"Academic Year",NA
