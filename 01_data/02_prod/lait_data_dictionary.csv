Inclusion of these indicators will encourage the continued prioritisation of breastfeeding support locally. Increases in breastfeeding are expected to reduce illness in young children, have health benefits for the infant and the mother and result in cost savings to the NHS through reduced hospital admission for the treatment of infection in infants (Quigley et al 2007.) Breast milk provides the ideal nutrition for infants in the first stages of life. There is evidence that babies who are breast fed experience lower levels of gastro-intestinal and respiratory infection. Observational studies have shown that breastfeeding is associated with lower levels of child obesity. Mothers who do not breastfeed have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers and may find it more difficult to return to their pre-pregnancy weight (World Cancer Research Fund; DH, cited in NICE Public health guidance PH11 https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph11/chapter/2-public-health-need-and-practice). Current national and international guidance recommends exclusive breastfeeding for newborns and for the first six months of infancy. http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/infantfeeding_recommendation/en/index.html  http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11943/40097/40097.pdf Increasing rates of breastfeeding initiation and continuation is also recommended within the DH Healthy Child Programme Breastfeeding initiation and uptake at 6-8 weeks are included in the NICE proposals for the Commissioning Outcomes Framework The longer-term strategic solution for data collection and reporting for this indicator is NHS England's Community Services Dataset (formerly the Children and Young Peoples (CYPHS) data set). It is mandatory for the providers of public funded services to submit the dataset to NHS England. Whilst the data set is operational and reporting has begun, providers are at different stages of maturity with their submissions or readiness to flow the data therefore it is expected to take some additional time for this data set to reach sufficient coverage for reporting purposes.

Partially breastfed is defined as infants who are currently receiving breast milk at 6 to 8 weeks of age and who are also receiving formula milk or any other liquids or food. Not at all breastfed is defined as infants who are not currently receiving any breast milk at 6 to 8 weeks of age.

Methodology: Crude percentage: numerator is divided by denominator and then multiplied by 100.
A process of estimation was applied to any local authority data where a return was submitted for only 3 quarters, or DK was submitted for any data item. An estimated numerator for the missing quarter was calculated as an average of the numerators of the other 3 quarters, and the same for an estimated denominator.

GCSEs and GNVQs are subject to discounting, as are AS and A/A2 levels. For example, say a learner gains an AS level (25% L3) in 2009 and then an A level (50% L3) in the same subject in 2010, then discounting means the person has 25% of a full Level 3 in 2009 and then 50% in 2010 as the AS level is replaced by the full A level.","45748","46113","DfE","Several data sources are matched together at an individual level, using personal identifiers.

This is typically the summer term of reception year. The assessment framework, or EYFS Profile, consists of 17 early learning goals (ELGs) across 7 areas of learning.

The statutory EYFS framework sets the standards and requirements that all early years providers must follow to ensure all children have the best start in life and are prepared for school. It requires that children be assessed against the EYFS Profile in the summer term of the academic year in which they turn 5.

The 3 prime areas of learning are: communication and language; personal, social and emotional development; and physical development. These prime areas are particularly important for children’s healthy development and are the basis for successful learning in the other 4 specific areas of learning: literacy; mathematics; understanding the world; and expressive arts and design.

For each test or teacher assessment, the number of pupils meeting the expected standard is the sum of all pupils with the following results:

For the reading, mathematics and grammar, punctuation, and spelling tests: achieved the expected standard or met the higher standard.
For the writing teacher assessment: working at the expected standard or working at a greater depth.
For the science teacher assessment: working at the expected standard.

Data on school stability is derived from matching the SSDA903 collection to the school census. The main matching key is the child’s unique pupil number (UPN), which identifies each pupil attending a state funded school in England. Allocated on first entry to a school, the UPN is generated using a nationally specified formula and is expected to remain with a pupil throughout their school career regardless of any change in school or local authority. Local authorities are required to return UPNs as part of the SSDA903 return. For more information on matching using UPN, see Outcomes for children in need, including children looked after by local authorities in England, Methodology – Explore education statistics – GOV.UK (explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk) Once matched, children whose date of birth differed between the SSDA903 collection and the school census were removed.","https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/children-looked-after-in-england-including-adoptions",NA,"Financial Year",NA

Absence data is collected one term in arrears of the school census. In 2020, due to the pandemic absence data for 2019/20 was only collected for the autumn term 2019. In 2020 and 2021 autumn term absence data was included in this statistical release. In recent years, autumn term absence rates have given reasonable indications of trends in the full year. However, absence in a single term can be more affected by the level of seasonal flu or other illnesses.

The appeal rate to the SEND Tribunal is now published as a percentage of all ‘appealable decisions’ on a calendar year basis.

Total Appealable Decisions is calculated from data collected by the DfE from the annual SEN2 data return, which is mandatory for local authorities to complete. The Total Appealable Decisions figure is calculated as the sum total of the following:
- Number of initial requests for Education, Health and Care (EHC) assessments refused
- Number of assessments completed and a decision made not to issue an EHC plan
- Number with an EHC plan as at January each year

During these sessions, these children could not attend school and so they are treated separately, and not counted within the standard absence rates within this publication. Where a pupil was not attending in these circumstances, schools were expected to provide immediate access to remote education. For most of the spring term, only children of critical workers and vulnerable pupils could attend school during the period of lockdown from 4 January 2021. Restrictions were lifted on attendance from 8 March 2021 for all other pupils, four school weeks prior to the end of term.

Statistics on the number of children (by age) and the proportion of children under 16 in low income families each year are published. Figures are calibrated to the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) survey estimates but provide more granular local area information not available from the HBAI.

Following the successful completion of discovery work and a period of user engagement, these Official Statistics now calibrate figures to HBAI single-year UK estimates (instead of HBAI 2 or 3 year regional estimates).  Proportions (also referred to as rates) are calculated by dividing the unrounded number of children aged under 16 in a geographical area (for example, a local authority), by the population aged under 16 in that geographical area. Populations have been taken from mid-year population estimates which are an estimate of the usual resident population as at 30 June of the reference year (or latest available at the time of release).

 - A family must have claimed Child Benefit and at least one other household benefit (Universal Credit, tax credits or Housing Benefit) at any point in the year to be classed as low income in these statistics.
 - Income is Before Housing Costs (BHC) and is equivalised to adjust for family size and composition. Income is defined as Gross Personal Income from benefits/tax credits, from employment and self-employment, and from occupational pensions. This is not the same as HBAI income measures, but for the purposes of looking at the distribution of family income across local areas, it offers a consistent approach that captures the main income streams.
 - Relationships are built from analyses of household benefits in payment. That is, information on sole or joint claimants of Universal Credit, Tax Credits and Housing Benefits which is used to determine claimant and partner information. When combined with Child Benefit claimant data, this view provides a measure of the family unit.

The grant also provides support for children and young people with parents in the regular armed forces, referred to as service pupil premium (SPP). This has been combined into pupil premium payments to make it easier for schools to manage their spending. Pupils that the SPP intends to support are not necessarily from financially disadvantaged backgrounds.

Pupil premium funding is allocated to eligible schools based on the number of: a)pupils who are recorded as eligible for free school meals, or have been recorded as eligible in the past 6 years (referred to as Ever 6 FSM), B) children previously looked after by a local authority or other state care, including children adopted from state care or equivalent from outside England and Wales.

Pupil premium is not a personal budget for individual pupils, and schools do not have to spend pupil premium so that it solely benefits pupils who meet the funding criteria. It can be used: a) to support other pupils with identified needs, such as those who have or have had a social worker, or who act as a carer, b) for whole class interventions which will also benefit non-disadvantaged pupils 

Pupil premium funding is allocated to local authorities based on the number of: a) looked-after children, supported by the local authority; b) pupils who meet any of the eligibility criteria and who attend an independent setting, where the local authority pays full tuition fees
