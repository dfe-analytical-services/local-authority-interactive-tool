In focus charts, the selected geography label is now bold and highlighted in blue for added clarity.",2025-02-14,NA
"Feature","Initial message","The development of the new R-Shiny LAIT is now complete! While the tool’s core functionality remains unchanged, the user experience has been significantly enhanced. Key features like interactive charts, easy downloads, and accessibility-friendly styling aim to empower users to extract meaningful insights on children’s services with ease.

Looking ahead, we’re excited about potential future enhancements, such as:

- Visualizing quartile bands for better comparisons.
- Enabling users to deselect geographies from the LA page charts.
- Highlighting years where local authorities’ values are statistically above or below average.
